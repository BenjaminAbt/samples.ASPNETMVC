Thank you for downloading ASP.NET MVC RouteCache by SchwabenCode

Please take a look on  http://benjamin-abt.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-routecache/ for help.
ExampleRoutes.xml contains some samples for your route configuration.
You have to create Routes.xml in your 'Routing' directory in your project for your routes.  

Thank you.
